Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas and Python

Objective:
The objective of this project is to provide students with hands-on experience in data analysis using Python's Pandas library. By analyzing a dataset containing information about various laptops, students will learn the process of data cleaning, filtering, grouping, and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib.

Dataset Description:
The dataset contains information about laptops, including attributes such as company, laptop type, screen size, resolution, CPU, RAM, memory, GPU, operating system, weight, and price.

Action Plan:

Step 1: Data Loading and Initial Exploration

1. Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Perform initial exploration:
    - Check the first few rows of the dataset.
    - Check data types and null values.
    - Get summary statistics for numerical columns.



Step 2: Data Cleaning

1. Handle missing values:
    - Drop or fill missing values based on the context of the data.
2. Clean and standardize data:
    - Convert data types if necessary (e.g., converting object types to numeric types).
    - Clean inconsistent or erroneous data entries.



Step 3: Data Filtering and Selection

1. Filter data based on specific criteria:
    - Filter laptops based on certain attributes like company, screen size, or operating system.
    - Select relevant columns for analysis.



Step 4: Data Grouping and Aggregation

1. Group data based on certain attributes:
    - Group laptops based on company, laptop type, or operating system.
2. Perform aggregation functions:
    - Calculate mean, median, or count within each group.



Step 6: Data Visualization

1. Plot the findings using Matplotlib:
    - Create plots such as histograms, scatter plots, or bar charts to visualize the data.
    - Utilize subplots to show multiple visualizations together ~ 2x2 grid.
    - Add appropriate labels, titles, and legends to enhance readability.



Questions we need answered:
1. What is the average price of laptops based on different companies?
2. How does the price distribution vary between laptops with SSD and HDD?
3. Which company has the highest average RAM capacity?
4. How does the weight of laptops vary across different screen resolutions?



Project Conclusion:

In conclusion, this project provides students with a comprehensive understanding of data analysis techniques using Pandas and Python. 
By following the outlined steps and exploring the provided dataset, students will gain practical experience in data manipulation, visualization, and interpretation, which are essential skills for data analysis and decision-making in various fields.
